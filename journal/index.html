      <p><b> living model worlds </b>
        <br>2025.09.04<br>
        Dream: I entered a 3D model scene of ancient China. As soon as I stepped in, everything in the scene was alive. A man
        dressed in brown clothes with a traditional topknot hairstyle walked up to me and asked if I needed help. The
        characters in the scene were in the style of toy soldiers. Some were civilians, others were
        officials or soldiers. Despite their toy-like appearance, their movements were smooth and lifelike, just like real
        beings. I stood there, surrounded by grand mountains, a sea of clouds, houses, and bustling fairs.
        <br>(It is noteworthy that I could return to reality at any time and choose from a variety of other model worlds to
        enter!)

      <p><b> electric blue, drifting fragment </b>
        <br>2025.05.29<br>
        Dream: On the 6th floor of a building, I experienced something unpleasant at a party. Wanting to clear my mind, I took
        my sparkly electric blue wig and walked alone to the window to enjoy the night view. That’s where I met D. As we
        talked, we took the elevator up to the 7th floor, and I erased the 6th floor from the elevator, turning it into a
        sealed box that was inaccessible to anyone.
        <br>Just as we were about to spend the rest of the night together, I saw the sky in the distance begin to crack apart.
        One fragment drifted off, floating silently into space.

        Dream: A body that looks like 2D from a distance is actually 3D, while a head that looks 3D is 2D up close.

      <p><b> industrial-grade survival capabilities </b>
        <br>2025.04.17<br>
        Can human beings develop industrial-grade survival capabilities? Is the essence of survival the
        ability to withstand risks both physically and psychologically? Humans possess adaptability, improving ourselves
        through our interaction with our surroundings, much like how stress tests determine and guide the robustness of a
        system. If we expose ourselves to stress tests and adapt accordingly, could we get closer to achieving
        industrial-grade survival?

      <p><b> a probable way to live without mortgage </b>
        <br>2025.04.14<br>
        \(\text{Rent Price per Month} \approx \frac{(\text{Real Estate Price} \times \text{Investment Interest Rate} +
        \text{Annual HOA} + \text{Real Estate Price} \times \text{Property Tax Rate})}{12}\) This formula is something I made
        up, it's very one-sided, and doesn't constitute any advice. Please don't take it seriously. Ha ha, wish you a happy life :)

      <p><b> hand and forearm </b>
        <br>2024.12.28<br>Last night, I had a dream. There was an embedded electronic module in my right forearm, and I could
        switch my skills and attributes through interactions like touching or rubbing my skin. For example, I could equip
        weapons like a sword or a peach blossom branch. The hand and forearm were detachable and replaceable.

      <p><b> humanity is a variable</b>
        <br>2024.05.22<br>We can't predict the future with historical data, and I reckon humanity is one of those
        variables. Humanity is constantly growing based on the reflection on the past and present, and as long as
        this quality remains, creativity will never die.

      <p><b> be honest </b>
        <br>2024.05.17<br>Sometimes our work is complimented as "cool", but that may have nothing to do with the idea
        itself. It is about information gaps when the audience doesn't know the technology under the hood.

      <br>
      <p><b> the length of 1,000 years </b>
        <br>2024.05.12<br>If one's life spans 100 years, then 1,000 years is akin to undergoing 10 reincarnations, with
        10 people queued ahead of us. Imagine waiting at a popular restaurant, where there are 10 people in line before
        you. And that is all.

      <p><b> kidnapped by deepfakes </b>
        <br>2024.01.22<br>Last night I dreamt a group of deepfakes kidnapped me to a room in a white lab, and by
        observing the details I realized they weren't actually real humans. I pointed out they are AI, by then
        they realized their flaws and finally released me.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><b> energetic AI </b>
        <br>2023.07.12<br>People are like AI, receiving feedback, training and evolving like a model. But AI can keep
        going non-stop, while we have to sleep.

      <p><b> prosthetic soul </b>
        <br>2023.01.24<br>How to describe the feeling of pretending? Is it like having a soul with an installed
        prosthetic? The premise of prosthetic is that we have a set of guidelines for what is "normal".

      <p><b> breathe like a performance </b>
        <br>2022.06.27<br>I went to a jazz bar in NYC with friends, and we were seated at the only table on the stage.
        Under the spotlight, which was the primary light source in the bar, everything we did was like a performance,
        even something as simple as breathing.
