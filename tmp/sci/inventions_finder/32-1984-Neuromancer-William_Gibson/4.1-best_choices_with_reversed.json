Techno-fetishism refers to our society's tendency to fetishize new technologies while ignoring their potential negative consequences; transhumanism refers to humanity's quest for immortality through scientific means such as genetic engineering or uploading one's consciousness into a computer system.

He was riding high that night, with a brick of Wage\u2019s ketamine on its way to Yokohama and the money already in his pocket. He\u2019d come in out of the warm rain that sizzled across the Ninsei pavement and somehow she\u2019d been singled out for him, one face out of the dozens who stood at the consoles, lost in the game she played. The expression on her face, then, had been the one he\u2019d seen, hours later, on her sleeping face in a port side coffin, her upper lip like the line children draw to represent a bird in flight. Crossing the arcade to stand beside her, high on the deal he\u2019d made, he saw her glance up. Gray eyes rimmed with smudged black paintstick. Eyes of some animal pinned in the headlights of an oncoming vehicle. Their night together stretching into a morning, into tickets at the hover port and his first trip across the Bay. The rain kept up, falling along Harajuku, beading on her plastic jacket, the children of Tokyo trooping past the famous boutiques in white loafers and cling wrap capes, until she\u2019d stood with him in the midnight clatter of a pachinko parlor and held his hand like a child. It took a month for the gestalt of drugs and tension he moved through to turn those perpetually startled eyes into wells of reflexive need. He\u2019d watched her personality fragment, calving like an iceberg, splinters drifting away, and finally he\u2019d seen the raw need, the hungry armature of addiction. He\u2019d watched her track the next hit with a concentration that reminded him of the mantises they sold in stalls along Shiga, beside tanks of blue mutant carp and crickets caged in bamboo.",
