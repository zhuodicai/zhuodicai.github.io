                            There is something new: A globe about the size of a grapefruit, a perfectly detailed
                            rendition of Planet Earth, hanging in space at arm's length in front of his eyes. Hiro has
                            heard about this but never seen it. It is a piece of CIC software called, simply, Earth. It
                            is the user interface that <b>CIC</b> uses to keep track of every bit of spatial information
                            that it owns - all the maps, weather data, architectural plans, and satellite surveillance
                            stuff.
                            Hiro has been thinking that in a few years, if he does really well in the intel biz, maybe
                            he will make enough money to subscribe to Earth and get this thing in his office. Now it is
                            suddenly here, free of charge...

                            blue eyes, wearing a V-neck sweater over a work shirt, with a coarsely woven, tweedy-looking
                            wool tie. The tie is loosened, the sleeves pushed up. Even though he's just a piece of
                            software, he has reason to be cheerful; he can move through the nearly infinite stacks of
                            information in the Library with the agility of a spider dancing across a vast web of
                            cross-references. The Librarian is the only piece of <b>CIC</b> software that costs even
                            more than Earth; the only thing he can't do is think.

                            No. It can't be. Someone is shadowing him. Right off his left flank. A person on a
                            skateboard rolling down the highway right behind him. The Deliverator, in his distracted
                            state, has allowed himself to get <b>pooned</b>. As in <b>harpooned</b>. There's a big round
                            padded electromagnet, on the end of an arachnofiber cable. It has just thunked on the back
                            of the Deliverator's car and stuck. Ten feet behind him, the owner of this cursed device is
                            surfing, taking him for a ride. Skateboarding along like a water-skier behind a boat.

                            In the rearview, flashes of orange and blue. The parasite is not just a punk out having a
                            good time. It is a businessman making money. The orange and blue coverall, bulging all over
                            with sintered armorgel padding, is the uniform of a Kourier. A Kourier from RadiKS, Radikal
                            Kourier Systems. Like a bicycle messenger, but a hundred times more irritating because they
                            don't pedal under their own power - they just latch on and slow you down.

                            No need to get rattled. The Kourier will have to <b>unpoon</b> or else be slammed sideways
                            into the slower vehicle.

                            Done. The Kourier isn't ten feet behind him anymore - he is right there, peering in the rear
                            window. Anticipating the maneuver, the Kourier reeled in his cord, which is attached to a
                            handle with a power reel in it, and is now right on top of the pizza mobile...

                            it, and slaps his driver's side window. The Deliverator has just been stickered. The sticker
                            is a foot across and reads, in big orange block letters, printed backward so that he can
                            read it from the inside:

                            while she works her way inward, and when she finally shoves her tongue into his ear canal,
                            he bucks and grunts like he's just been <b>harpooned</b>, lifts her up off his leg, kicks
                            the chair across the room so hard it cracks against the steel wall of the shipping
                            container. She feels herself falling backward toward the futon, thinks for a moment she's
                            about to get crushed beneath him, but he catches all the weight on his elbows, except for
                            his lower body, which slams into hers all at once, sending another electric shot of pleasure
                            up her back and down her legs.

                            Originally, it was spread around on comets. That's probably how life first came to the
                            Earth, and that's probably how the metavirus came here also. But comets are slow, whereas
                            radio waves are fast. In binary form, a virus can bounce around the universe at the speed of
                            light. It infects a civilized planet, gets into its computers, reproduces, and inevitably
                            gets broadcast on television or radio or whatever. Those transmissions don't stop at the
                            edge of the atmosphere—they radiate out into space, forever. And if they hit a planet with
                            another civilized culture, where people are listening to the stars the way Rife was doing,
                            then that planet gets infected, too. I think that was Rife's plan, and I think it worked.

                                a computer, it snow-crashes the computer by causing it to infect itself with new
                                viruses. But it is much more devastating when it goes into the mind of a hacker, a
                                person who has an understanding of binary code built into the deep structures of his
                                brain. The binary metavirus will destroy the mind of a hacker.”

                                “So Rife can control two kinds of people,” Ng says. “He can control Pentecostals by
                                using me written in the mother tongue. And he can control hackers in a much more violent
                                fashion by damaging their brains with binary viruses.”

                                planets. It stood to reason that sooner or later, one of his dishes would pick up the

                            and asked them questions about Ethics so perplexing that even a Jesuit couldn't respond
                            without committing a venial sin. The analysts at CosaNostra Pizza University concluded that
                            it was just human nature and you couldn't fix it, and so they went for a quick cheap
                            technical fix: smart boxes.
                            <b>
                                The pizza box is a plastic carapace now, corrugated for stiffness, a little LED readout
                                glowing on the side, telling the Deliverator how many trade imbalance-producing minutes
                                have ticked away since the fateful phone call. There are chips and stuff in there. The
                                pizzas rest, a short stack of them, in slots behind the Deliverator's head. Each pizza
                                glides into a slot like a circuit board into a computer, clicks into place as the smart
                                box interfaces with the onboard system of the Deliverator's car. The address of the
                                caller has already been inferred from his phone number and poured into the smart box's
                                built-in RAM. From there it is communicated to the car, which computes and projects the
                                optimal route on a heads-up display, a glowing colored map traced out against the
                                windshield so that the Deliverator does not even have to glance down.

                            If the thirty-minute deadline expires, news of the disaster is flashed to CosaNostra Pizza
                            Headquarters and relayed from there to Uncle Enzo himself—the Sicilian Colonel Sanders, the
                            Andy Griffith of Bensonhurst, the straight razor-swinging figment of many a Deliverator's
                            nightmares, the Capo and prime figurehead of CosaNostra Pizza, Incorporated—who will be on
                            the phone to the customer within five minutes, apologizing profusely. The next day, Uncle
                            Enzo will land on the customer's yard in a jet helicopter and apologize some more and give
                            him a free trip to Italy—all he has to do is sign a bunch of releases that make him a public
                            figure and spokesperson for CosaNostra Pizza and basically end his private life as he knows
                            it.

                            mufflers and other debris. Each one consists of a hub with many tiny spokes. Each spoke
                            telescopes into five sections. On the end is a squat foot, rubber tread on the bottom,
                            swiveling on a ball joint. As the wheel rolls, the feet plant themselves one at a time,
                            almost glomming into one continuous tire. If you surf over a bump, the spokes contract to
                            roll over it. If you surf over a pothole, the rubber prongs probe its asphalt depths. Either
                            way, the shock is thereby absorbed, no thuds, smacks, vibrations, or clunks will make their

                            coffee cups and take their feet off their desks to go outside and look at it. It looks like
                            a black land torpedo. Two-wheel drive, natch. The wheels are so advanced they're not even
                            wheels—they look like giant, heavy-duty versions of the <b>smartwheels</b> that high-speed
                            skateboards use, independently telescoping spokes with fat traction pads on the ends.
                            Dangling out over the front, in the nose cone of the motorcycle, is the sensor package that
                            monitors road conditions, decides where to place each spoke as it rolls forward, how much to
                            extend it, and how to rotate the footpad for maximum traction. It's all controlled by a
                            bios—a Built-In Operating System—an onboard computer with a flat-panel screen built into the
                            top of the fuel tank.

                            cylinders into action. She sees it catercorner from her present coordinates. The white

                            to lawn without a hitch. Across the lawn, the feet leave a trail of hexagonal padmarks. A
                            stray dog turd, red with meaty undigestible food coloring, is embossed with the RadiKS logo,
                            a mirror image of which is printed on the tread of each spoke.

                            Hiro Protagonist and Vitaly Chernobyl, roommates, are chilling out in their home, a spacious
                            20 by 30 in a <b>U-Stor-It</b> in Inglewood, California. The room has a concrete slab floor,
                            corrugated steel walls separating it from the neighboring units and - this is a mark of
                            distinction separating it from the neighboring units - a roll-up steel door that faces
                            northwest, giving them a few red rays at times like this, when the sun is setting over LAX.
                            But there are worse places to live… slum housing, 5-by-10s and 10-by-10s where Yanoama
                            tribespersons cook beans and parboil fistfuls of coca leaves over heaps of burning lottery
                            tickets.

                            corrugated-steel hallways and freight elevators. These are slum housing, 5-by-10s and

                            heaps of burning lottery tickets. It is whispered that in the old days, when the
                            <b>U-Stor-It</b> was actually used for its intended purpose (namely, providing cheap extra
                            storage space to Californians with too many material goods), certain entrepreneurs came to
                            the front office, rented out 10-by-10s using fake IDs, filled them up with steel drums full
                            of toxic chemical waste, and then abandoned them, leaving the problem for the U-Stor-It
                            Corporation to handle. According to these rumors, U-Stor-It just padlocked those units and
                            wrote them off. Now, the immigrants claim, certain units remain haunted by this chemical
                            specter. It is a story they tell their children, to keep them from trying to break into
                            padlocked units.
