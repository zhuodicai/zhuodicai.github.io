                            "We monitor many frequencies. We listen always. Came a voice, out of the babel of tongues,
                            speaking to us. It played us a mighty <b>dub</b>."
                            "Call 'em Winter Mute," said the other, making it two words.
                            Case felt the skin crawl on his arms...
                            "You ever hear this voice before?"
                            "No," said the man from Los Angeles, "and we are uncertain of its meaning. If these are
                            Final Days, we must expect false prophets..."
                            "Listen," Case said, "that's an AI, you know? Artificial intelligence. The music it played
                            you, it probably just tapped your banks and cooked up whatever it thought you'd like to --"
                            "Babylon," broke in the other Founder, "mothers many demon, I an' I know. Multitude horde!"

                            “You help me string this up.” He looked around the wide, featureless space and noticed steel
                            rings welded on every surface, seemingly at random. When they’d strung the cables, according
                            to some complex scheme of Molly’s, they hung them with battered sheets of yellow plastic.
                            <u>
                                As they worked, Case gradually became aware of the music that pulsed constantly through
                                the cluster.
                                It was called <b>dub</b>, a sensuous mosaic cooked from vast libraries of digitalized
                                pop; it was worship, Molly said, and a sense of community.
                            </u>
                            Case heaved at one of the yellow sheets; the thing was light but still awkward.

                            The local came booming in along the black induction strip, fine grit sifting from cracks in
                            the tunnel’s ceiling. Case shuffled into the nearest door and watched the other passengers
                            as he rode. A pair of predatory-looking Christian Scientists were edging toward a trio of
                            young office techs who wore idealized holographic vaginas on their wrists, wet pink
                            glittering under the harsh lighting. The techs licked their perfect lips nervously and eyed
                            the Christian Scientists from beneath lowered metallic lids. The girls looked like tall,
                            exotic grazing animals, swaying gracefully and unconsciously with the movement of the train,
                            their high heels like polished hooves against the gray metal of the car’s floor. Before they
                            could stampede, take flight from the missionaries, the train reached Case’s station. He
                            stepped out and caught sight of a white holographic cigar suspended against the wall of the
                            station, FREESIDE pulsing beneath it in contorted capitals that mimicked printed Japanese.
                            He walked through the crowd and stood beneath it, studying the thing.

                            She was leaning against the wall, taking all of her weight on her right leg. She fumbled
                            through the content's of the suit's kangaroo pocket and withdrew a sheet of plastic studded
                            with a rainbow of <b>dermadisks</b>. Six thousand micrograms of endorphin analog came down
                            on the pain like a hammer, shattering it. Her back arched convulsively. Pink waves of warmth
                            lapped up her thighs. She sighed and slowly relaxed.

                            little units under it: the radio, the Simstim unit, and the scrambler. The throat mike,
                            glued to her neck, looked as much as possible like an analgesic <b>dermadisk</b>. Her hands,
                            in the pockets of the pink coat, were flexing systematically through a series of
                            tension-release exercises. It took him a few seconds to realize that the peculiar sensation
                            at the tips of her fingers was caused by the blades as they were partially extruded, then
                            retracted. He flipped back. His program had reached the fifth gate. He watched as his
                            icebreaker strobed and shifted in front of him, only faintly aware of his hands playing
                            across the deck, making minor adjustments. Translucent planes of color shuffled like a trick

                            Case waited for a trans-BAMA local on the crowded platform. Molly had gone back to the loft
                            hours ago, the Flatline’s construct in her green bag, and Case had been drinking steadily
                            ever since. It was disturbing to think of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM
                            cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses… The local came
                            booming in along the black induction strip, fine grit sifting from cracks in the tunnel’s
                            ceiling. Case shuffled into the nearest door and watched the other passengers as he rode. A
                            pair of predatory-looking Christian Scientists were edging toward a trio of young office
                            techs who wore idealized holographic vaginas on their wrists, wet pink glittering under the
                            harsh lighting. The techs licked their perfect lips nervously and eyed the Christian
                            Scientists from beneath lowered metallic lids. The girls looked like tall, exotic grazing
                            animals, swaying gracefully and unconsciously with the movement of the train, their high
                            heels like polished hooves against the gray metal of the car’s floor. Before they could
                            stampede, take flight from the missionaries, the train reached Case’s station. He stepped
                            out and caught sight of a white holographic cigar suspended against the wall of the station,
                            <b>FREESIDE</b> pulsing beneath it in contorted capitals that mimicked printed Japanese. He
                            walked through the crowd and stood beneath it, studying the thing.

                            She closed her eyes and there was a click that Case felt rather than heard. It made him
                            remember the magnetic locks on the door of her cubicle in the puppet place. The door had
                            opened for him, even though he’d had the wrong chip. That was Wintermute, manipulating the
                            lock the way it had manipulated the drone micro and the robot gardener. The lock system in
                            the puppet place had been a subunit of </b>Freeside’s security system. The simple mechanical
                            lock here would pose a real problem for the AI, requiring either a drone of some kind or a
                            human agent. She opened her eyes, put the pick back into the chamois, carefully rerolled it,
                            and tucked it back into its pocket.

                            the dead center of reality. Until they had arranged themselves, individually and in their
                            hundreds, to form a vast simple portrait, stippled the ultimate monochrome, stars against
                            night sky. Face of Miss Linda Lee. When he was able to look away, to lower his eyes, he
                            found every other face in the street upraised, the strolling tourists becalmed with wonder.

                            hotel room. In Straylight, the hull’s inner surface is overgrown with a desperate
                            proliferation of structures, forms flowing, interlocking, rising toward a solid core of
                            microcircuitry, our clan’s corporate heart, a cylinder of silicon wormholed with narrow
                            maintenance tunnels, some no wider than a man’s hand. The bright crabs burrow there, the
                            drones, alert for micromechanical decay or sabotage.” “That was her you saw in the
                            restaurant,” the Finn said. “By the standards of the archipelago,” the head continued, “ours
                            is an old family, the convolutions of our home reflecting that age. But reflecting something
                            else as well. The semiotics of the Villa bespeak a turning in, a denial of the bright void
                            beyond the hull. “Tessier and Ashpool climbed the well of gravity to discover that they

                                suit</b> with a recording feature that allowed him to replay backgrounds at will.
                            Perched on the edge of Case's worktable like some sort of state of the art gargoyle, he

                            crawled out through a hinged, ornate grill of tarnished brass. He saw enough of her arms and
                            hands to know that she wore the <b>polycarbon suit</b> again. Under the plastic, he felt the
                            familiar tension of thin tight leather. There was something slung under her arm in a harness
                            or holster. She stood up, unzipped the suit and touched the checkered plastic of a
                            pistolgrip.

                            The <b>Panther Moderns</b> allowed four minutes for their first move to take effect, then
                            injected a second carefully prepared dose of misinformation. This time, they shot it
                            directly into the Sense/Net building’s internal video system. At 12:04:03, every screen in
                            the building strobed for eighteen seconds in a frequency that produced seizures in a

                            obscene Mercator projection. Blue lips parted wetly as the twisted, elongated jaw moved.
                            Something, perhaps a hand, a thing like a reddish clump of gnarled roots, fumbled toward the
                            camera, blurred, and vanished. Subliminally rapid images of contamination: graphics of the

                            tumbling down into darkness, a pale splash… The audio track, its pitch adjusted to run at
                            just less than twice the standard playback speed, was part of a month-old newscast detailing
                            potential military uses of a substance known as HsG, a biochemical governing the human

                            out as Molly ducked past it. Four square walls of blank white plastic, ceiling to match,

                            seemed to have been designed in a wind tunnel. His ears were very small, plastered flat

                            a smile, were canted sharply backward. He wore an ancient tweed jacket and held a handgun of
                            some kind in his left hand. He peered at them, blinked, and dropped the gun into a jacket
                            pocket. He gestured to Case, pointed at a slab of white plastic that leaned near the

                            silver boot-tip clanging on the silver carapace. The thing fell on its back, but the bronze
                            limbs soon righted it.
