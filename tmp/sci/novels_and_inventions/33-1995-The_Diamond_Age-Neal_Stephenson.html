                            A band of forest surrounded the high central plateau of New Chusan. The <b>clave</b> called
                            Dovetail backed right up against this greenbelt and was no less densely wooded, though from
                            a distance it had a finer texture—more and smaller trees, and many flowers. Dovetail was
                            surrounded by a fence made of iron bars and painted black. Harv took one look at it and said
                            it was a joke if that was all the security they had. Then he got to noticing that the fence
                            was lined with a greensward about a stone's throw in width, smooth enough for championship
                            croquet. He raised his eyebrows significantly at Nell, implying that any unauthorized
                            personnel who tried to walk across it would be impaled on hydraulic stainless-steel spikes
                            or shot through with cookie-cutters or rent by robot dogs.

                            ecosystems were especially tiresome when they got fubared, so they protected the environment
                            with the same implacable, plodding, green-visored mentality that they applied to designing
                            overpasses and culverts. Thus, water seeped into Source Victoria through microtubes, much
                            the same way it seeped into a beach, and air wafted into it silently down the artfully
                            skewed exponential horns of those thrusting calla lilies, each horn a point in parameter
                            space not awfully far from some central ideal. They were strong enough to withstand typhoons
                            but flexible enough to rustle in a breeze. Birds, wandering inside, sensed a gradient in the
                            air, pulling them down into night, and simply chose to fly out.

                                bone in the skull—anywhere a big bone was close to the surface. A bone mount was needed
                                because the card had to talk on the radio, which meant it needed an antenna long enough
                                to hear radio waves. Then you could go around and buy stuff just by asking for it;
                                Peacock Bank and the merchant you were buying from and the card in your pelvis handled
                                all the details. Banks varied in their philosophy of interest rates, minimum monthly
                                payments, and so on.

                            wouldn't whine... A Jodie was top of the line, it had a hundred times as many 'sites as the
                            lo-res grid sported by many a porn starlet, something like ten thousand of them in the face
                            alone...
                            When her face had gotten back to looking exactly the same as it had before her trip to the
                            tat parlor, she packed everything she owned into a carpet bag and took the tube into the
                            city.

                            "Let's have a gander at your grid, sweetheart," said a man identifying himself as Mr. Fred

                            Miranda was looking at a black wall speckled with twenty or thirty thousand individual
                            pinpricks of white light. Taken together, they formed a sort of three-dimensional
                            constellation of Miranda, moving as she moved. Each point of light marked one of the 'sites
                            that had been poked into her skin by the tat machine during those sixteen hours. Not shown
                            were the filaments that tied them all together into a network - a new bodily system overlaid
                            and interlaced with the nervous, lymph and vascular systems...

                            Suddenly a blond, blue-eyed woman was standing in the mediatron, perfectly aping Miranda's
                            posture, wearing big hair, a white sweater with a big letter F in the middle, and a
                            preposterously short skirt...

                            ...for the first time ever, she was watching another person move exactly as she moved, as
                            the stage mapped Miranda's grid onto this imaginary body. Miranda pressed her lips together

                            dense as a galactic core. By comparison, her arms and legs were wispy nebulas and the back
                            of her head nearly invisible, with a grand total of maybe a hundred 'sites placed around her
                            scalp like the vertices of a geodesic dome. The eyes were empty holes, except (she imagined)
                            when she closed her eyes. Just to check it out, she winked into the mediatron. The 'sites on
                            her eyelids were dense as grass blades on a putting green, but accordioned together except
                            when the lid expanded over the eye. Fred Epidermis recognized the move and zoomed in so
                            violently on her winking eye that she nearly threw herself back on her ass.

                            had actually been growing down on the bottom of the ocean for the last three months, drawing
                            its energy from a supercon that they'd grown across the seafloor for the occasion,
                            extracting the necessary atoms directly from the seawater and the gases dissolved therein.

                            awakened to find a small present under her pillow, unwrapped it to find a golden whistle on
                            a chain, stood out on her balcony, and blown the whistle. The coral was converging on the
                            site of the island from all directions, some of the <b>lithocules</b> traveling several
                            kilometers
                            to reach their assigned positions. They displaced a volume of water equal to the island
                            itself, several cubic kilometers in all. The result was furious turbulence, an up-swelling
                            in the surface of the ocean that made some of the children scream, thinking it might rise up
                            and snatch the airship out of the sky; and indeed a few drops pelted the ship's diamond
                            belly, prompting the pilot to give her a little more altitude.

                            In the beginning was an empty chamber, a diamond hemisphere, glowing with dim red light. In
                            the center of the floor slab, one could see a naked cross-section of an eight-centimeter
                            Feed, a central vacuum pipe surrounded by a collection of smaller lines, each a bundle of
                            microscopic conveyor belts carrying nanomechanical building blocks—individual atoms, or
                            scores of them linked together in handy modules.
                            <u>The <b>matter compiler</b> was a machine that sat at the terminus of a Feed and,
                                following a
                                program, plucked molecules from the conveyors one at a time and assembled them into more
                                complicated structures. Hackworth was the programmer. Runcible was the program. It was
                                made
                                up of a number of subprograms, each of which had resided on a separate piece of paper
                                until
                                a few minutes ago, when the immensely powerful computer in Hackworth's office had
                                compiled
                                them into a single finished program written in a language that the matter compiler could
                                understand. A transparent haze coalesced across the terminus of the Feed, mold on an
                                overripe strawberry. The haze thickened and began adopting a shape, some parts a little
                                higher than others. It spread across the floor away from the Feed line until it had
                                filled
                                out its footprint: one quadrant of a circle with a radius of a dozen centimeters.</u>
                            Hackworth continued to watch until he was sure he could see the top edge of the book growing
                            out of it. In the corner of this lab stood an evolved version of a copy machine that could
                            take just about any kind of recorded information and transmogrify it into something else. It
                            could even destroy a piece of information and then attest to the fact that it had been
                            destroyed, which was useful in the relatively paranoid environment of Bespoke. Hackworth
                            gave it the document containing the compiled Runcible code and destroyed it. Provably.

                            Nell followed him into the kitchen, which housed several important boxy entities with
                            prominent doors. Some were warm, some cool, some had windows, some made noises. Nell had
                            frequently seen Harv, or Tequila, or one of Tequila's boyfriends, removing food from them,
                            in one stage or another of doneness. One of the boxes was called the <b>M.C.</b> It was
                            built into the wall over the counter. Nell dragged a chair and climbed up to watch as Harv
                            worked at it. The front of the <b>M.C.</b> was a mediatron, which meant anything that had
                            pictures moving around on it, or sound coming out of it, or both. As Harv poked it with his
                            fingers and spoke to it, little moving pictures danced around. It reminded her of the
                            ractives she played on the big mediatron in the living room, when it wasn't being used by
                            someone bigger. “What are those?” Nell said. “Mediaglyphics,” Harv said coolly.

                            Harv got a bandage for his wrist and a cold-pack for his eye, and he asked the <b>M.C.</b>
                            for something to put on their cuts and burns so they wouldn't get infected. The <b>M.C.</b>
                            displayed a whole menu of mediaglyphs for different kinds of remedies. Some of them were
                            premiums, which you had to pay money for, and there were a few freebies. One of the freebies
                            was a cream that came in a tube, like toothpaste.

                            Nell already knew the <b>mediaglyphics</b> for it. Harv had also taught her the sign for
                            Enchantment, which was the name of the Territory they lived; it was a princess sprinkling
                            golden specks onto some gray houses, which turned yellow and bright were the specs touched
                            them.

                            Nell followed him into the kitchen, which housed several important boxy entities with
                            prominent doors. Some were warm, some cool, some had windows, some made noises. Nell had
                            frequently seen Harv, or Tequila, or one of Tequila's boyfriends, removing food from them,
                            in one stage or another of doneness. One of the boxes was called the M.C. It was built into
                            the wall over the counter. Nell dragged a chair and climbed up to watch as Harv worked at
                            it. The front of the M.C. was a mediatron, which meant anything that had pictures moving
                            around on it, or sound coming out of it, or both. As Harv poked it with his fingers and
                            spoke to it, little moving pictures danced around. It reminded her of the ractives she
                            played on the big mediatron in the living room, when it wasn't being used by someone bigger.
                            “What are those?” Nell said. “<b>Mediaglyphics</b>,” Harv said coolly.

                            Three people were waiting. Bud took a seat and skimmed a mediatron from the coffee table; it
                            looked exactly like a dirty, wrinkled, blank sheet of paper. “ 'Annals of Self-Protection,'
                            ” he said, loud enough for everyone else in the place to hear him. The logo of his favorite
                            meedfeed coalesced on the page. <b>Mediaglyphics</b>, mostly the cool animated ones,
                            arranged themselves in a grid. Bud scanned through them until he found the one that denoted
                            a comparison of a bunch of different stuff, and snapped at it with his fingernail. New
                            <b>mediaglyphics</b> appeared, surrounding larger cine panes in which Annals staff tested
                            several models of skull guns against live and dead targets. Bud frisbeed the mediatron back
                            onto the table; this was the same review he'd been poring over for the last day, they hadn't
                            updated it, his decision was still valid. One of the guys ahead of him got a tattoo, which
                            took about ten seconds. The other guy just wanted his skull gun reloaded, which didn't take
                            much longer. The girl wanted a few 'sites replaced in her racting grid, mostly around her
                            eyes, where she was starting to wrinkle up. That took a while, so Bud picked up the
                            mediatron again and went in a ractive, his favorite, called Shut Up or Die! The mod artist
                            wanted to see Bud's yuks before he installed the gun, which in other surroundings might have
                            been construed as an insult but was standard business practice here in the Leased
                            Territories. When he was satisfied that this wasn't a stick-up, he theezed Bud's forehead
                            with a spray gun, scalped back a flap of skin, and pushed a machine, mounted on a delicate
                            robot arm like a dental tool, over Bud's forehead. The arm homed in automatically on the old
                            gun, moving with alarming speed and determination. Bud, who was a little jumpy at the best
                            of times because of his muscle stimulators, flinched a little. But the robot arm was a
                            hundred times faster than he was and plucked out the old gun unerringly. The proprietor was
                            watching all of this on a screen and had nothing to do except narrate: “The hole in your
                            skull's kind of rough, so the machine is reaming it out to a larger bore—okay, now here
                            comes the new gun.” A nasty popping sensation radiated through Bud's skull when the robot
                            arm snapped in the new model.

                            Justice is served. The revolving chain of a nunchuk has a unique radar signature—reminiscent
                            of that of a helicopter blade, but noisier,” Miss Pao said, gazing up at Judge Fang over the
                            half-lenses of her phenomenoscopic spectacles. Her eyes went out of focus, and she winced;
                            she had been lost in some enhanced three-dimensional image, and the adjustment to dull
                            reality was disorienting. “A cluster of such patterns was recognized by one of Shanghai
                            P.D.'s sky-eyes at ten seconds after 2351 hours.”

                            Miss Pao continued, “The sky-eye dispatched a flight of eight smaller aerostats equipped
                            with cine cameras.” The kinky football was replaced by a picture of a teardrop-shaped craft,
                            about the size of an almond, trailing a whip antenna, with an orifice at its nose protected
                            by an incongruously beautiful iris. Judge Fang was not really looking; at least
                            three-quarters of the cases that came before him commenced with a summary almost exactly
                            like this one. It was a credit to Miss Pao's seriousness and diligence that she was able to
                            tell each story afresh. It was a challenge to Judge Fang's professionalism for him to listen
                            to each one in the same spirit. “Converging on the scene,” Miss Pao said, “they recorded
                            activities.” The large map image on Judge Fang's scroll was replaced by a cine feed. The
                            figures were far away, flocks of relatively dark pixels nudging their way across a rough
                            gray background like starlings massing before a winter gale. They got bigger and more
                            clearly defined as the aerostat flew closer to the action.

                            like little crabs and had been quietly inhabiting the outer layers of other creatures bodies
                            for hundreds of millions of years.

                                The hull was a vacuole, a wee bit of the eutactic environment to coddle the mite's
                                machine-phase innards. The hull's diamondoid structure was protected from the light by a
                                thin layer of aluminum that made mites look like miniature spaceships—only with the air
                                on
                                the outside and the vacuum inside. Attached to the hulls were various bits of gear:
                                manipulators, sensors, locomotion systems, and antennas. The antennas were not at all
                                like
                                the ones on an insect—they were usually flat patches studded with what looked like
                                close-cropped fuzz—phased-array systems for sweeping beams of visible light through the
                                air.
                                Most of the mites were also clearly marked with the manufacturer's name and a part
                                number;
                                this was demanded by Protocol. A few of them were unmarked. These were illicit and had

                                invented either by people like Dr. X; by outlaw phyles who spurned Protocol; or by the
                                covert labs that most people assumed were run by all the zaibatsus.

                            rooting around through Hackworth's skin, roaming around an area perhaps a millimeter on a
                            side, they observed a few dozen artificial mites, not an unusual number nowadays.

                            As usual, the tag <b>mites</b> were equipped with inertial navigation systems that recorded
                            all of the suspect's subsequent movements.” The big cine feed was replaced by a map of the
                            Leased Territories with the suspect's movements traced out with a red line. This boy did a
                            lot of wandering about, even going into Shanghai on occasion, but he always came back to the
                            same apartment. “After a pattern was established, the tag mites automatically spored,” Miss
                            Pao said. The image of the barbed dart altered itself, the midsection—which contained a
                            taped record of the dart's movements—breaking free and accelerating into the void. “Several
                            of the spores found their way to a sky-eye, where their contents were downloaded and their
                            serial numbers checked against police records. It was determined that the suspect spent much
                            of his time in a particular apartment. Surveillance was placed on that apartment. One of the
                            residents clearly matched the suspect seen on the cine feed. The suspect was placed under
                            arrest and additional tag mites found in his body, tending to support our suspicions.”
                            “Oooh,” Chang blurted, absently, as if he'd just remembered something important. “What do we
                            know about the victim?” Judge Fang said.

                            Their manufacturers compensated for this by making a lot of them. Nearly all of the mites
                            were connected in some way with the Victorian immune system, and of these, most were
                            immunocules whose job was to drift around the dirty littoral of New Chusan using
                            <b>lidar</b> to home in on any other mites that might disobey Protocol. Finding one, they
                            killed the invader by grabbing onto it and not letting go. The Victorian system used
                            Darwinian techniques to create killers adapted to their prey, which was elegant and
                            effective but led to the creation of killers that were simply too bizarre to have been
                            thought up by humans, just as humans designing a world never would have thought up the naked
                            mole rat. Dr. X took time out to zoom in on an especially freakish killer locked in a
                            death-grip around an unlabeled mite.

                            As the sea rose over him, it lifted the bowler from his head, and the hat continued to bob
                            on the tide for some minutes as the Chinese detonated strings of firecrackers on the shore
                            and tiny shreds of the red paper wrappers drifted over the sea like cherry petals. On one of
                            her forays into the surf, Nell had encountered a man—a Drummer—who had come swimming out of
                            the deep, naked except for a gill pack. This should have astonished her; instead, she had
                            known he was out there before she saw him, and when he came close, she could feel things
                            happening in her mind that were coming in from outside. There was something in her brain
                            that made her connected to the Drummers. Nell had drawn up some general plans and given them
                            to her engineers for further elaboration, and they had given them to Carl, who had taken
                            them to a functioning portable M.C. in the New Atlantan camp and compiled a little system
                            for examining and manipulating nanotechnological devices. In the dark, motes of light
                            sparkled in Nell's flesh, like airplane beacons in the night sky. They scraped one of these
                            away with a scalpel and examined it. They found similar devices circulating in her
                            bloodstream. These things, they realized, must have been put into Nell's blood when she was
                            raped. It was clear that the sparkling lights in Nell's flesh were beacons signaling to
                            others across the gulf that separates each of us from our neighbors. Carl opened one of the
                            things from Nell's blood and found a rod logic system inside, and a tape drive containing
                            some few gigabytes of data. The data was divided into discrete chunks, each one of which was
                            separately encrypted. Carl tried all of the keys that he had obtained from John Percival
                            Hackworth and found that one of them—Hackworth's key—unlocked some of the chunks. When he
                            examined the decrypted contents, he discovered fragments of a plan for some kind of
                            nanotechnological device. They drew blood from several volunteers and found that one of them
                            had the same little devices in his blood. When they put two of these devices in close
                            proximity, they locked onto one another using <b>lidar</b> and embraced, exchanging data and
                            performing some sort of computation that threw off waste heat. The devices lived in the
                            blood of the human race like viruses and passed from one person to the next during sex or
                            any other exchange of bodily fluids; they were smart packets of data, just like the ones
                            traversing the media network, and by mating with one another in the blood, they formed a
                            vast system of communication, parallel to and probably linked with the dry Net of optical
                            lines and copper wires. Like the dry Net, the wet Net could be used for doing
                            computations—for running programs. And it was now clear that John Percival Hackworth was
                            using it for exactly that, running some kind of vast distributed program of his own
                            devising. He was designing something. “Hackworth is the Alchemist,” Nell said, “and he is
                            using the wet Net to design the Seed.” Half a kilometer offshore, the tunnels began.

                            The book spoke in a lovely contralto, with an accent like the very finest Vickys. The voice
                            was like a real person's - though not like anyone Nell had ever met. It rose and fell like
                            slow surf on a warm beach and when Nell closed her eyes, it swept her out into an ocean of
                            feelings.

                            Once upon a time there was a little Princess named Nell who was imprisoned in a tall dark
                            castle on an island in the middle of a great sea... from time to time a raven would come to
                            visit...

                            "What's a raven?" Nell said.

                            ... it turned out to be a bird. Big letters appeared beneath. "R A V E N," the book said.
                            "Raven. Now, say it with me."

                            "Raven."

                            "Very good! Nell, you are a clever girl, and you have much talent with words. Can you spell
                            raven?"

                            ...After a few seconds, the first of the letters began to blink. Nell prodded it.

                            The letter grew until it had pushed all the other letters and pictures off the edges of the
                            page...

                            had always meant racting with other characters in the book while also having to think her
                            way through various interesting situations.

                            she wasn't so sure. Princess Nell's recent travels through the lands of King Coyote, and the
                            various castles with their increasingly sophisticated computers that were, in the end,
                            nothing more than Turing machines, had caught her up in a bewildering logical circle. <u>In
                                Castle Turing she had learned that a Turing machine could not really understand a human
                                being. But the <b>Primer</b> was, itself, a Turing machine, or so she suspected; so how
                                could it understand Nell? Could it be that the <b>Primer</b> was just a conduit, a
                                technological system that mediated between Nell and some human being who really loved
                                her? In the end, she knew, this was basically how all ractives worked.</u> The idea was
                            too alarming to consider at first, and so she circled around it cautiously, poking at it
                            from different directions, like a cavewoman discovering fire for the first time. But as she
                            settled in closer, she found that it warmed her and satisfied her, and by the time her mind
                            wandered into sleep, she had become dependent upon it and would not consider going back into
                            the cold and dark place where she had been traveling for so many years. Carl Hollywood
                            returns to Shanghai; his forebears in the territory of the Lone Eagles; Mrs. Kwan's
                            teahouse. Heavy rains had come rolling into Shanghai from the West, like a harbinger of the
                            Fists of Righteous Harmony and the thundering herald of the coming Celestial Kingdom.
                            Stepping off the airship from London, Carl Hollywood at once felt himself in a different
                            Shanghai from the one he had left; the old city had always been wild, but in a sophisticated
                            urban way, and now it was wild like a frontier town. He sensed this ambience before he even
                            left the Aerodrome; it leaked in from the streets, like ozone before a thunderstorm. Looking
                            out the windows, he could see a heavy rain rushing down, knocking all the nanotech out of
                            the air and down into the gutters, whence it would eventually stain the Huang Pu and then
                            the Yangtze.

                            The pressures of fatherhood! One day Bud targeted a particularly well-dressed family because
                            of their fancy clothes. The man was wearing a business suit and the woman a nice clean
                            dress, and they were carrying a baby all dressed up in a white lacy thing, and they had
                            hired a porter to help them haul their luggage away from the Aerodrome. The porter was a
                            white guy who vaguely reminded Bud of himself, and he was incensed to see him acting as a
                            pack animal for blacks. So as soon as these people got away from the bustle of the Aerodrome
                            and into a more secluded neighborhood, Bud approached them, swaggering in the way he'd
                            practiced in the mirror, occasionally pushing his <b>Sights</b> up on his nose with one
                            index finger.

                            about them, like a lot of the new arrivals did, and Bud noticed the way the man's gaze
                            lingered on his <b>Sights</b>, wondering whether those crosshairs, invisible to him, were

                            twitched Bud's muscle fibers electrically according to a program that was supposed to
                            maximize bulk. Combined with the testosterone pump embedded in his forearm, it was like
                            working out in a gym night and day, except you didn't have to actually do anything and you
                            never got sweaty. The only drawback was that all the little twitches made him kind of tense
                            and jerky. He'd gotten used to it, but it still made him a little hinky on those skates,
                            especially when he was doing a hundred clicks an hour through a crowded street.

                            the court physician had thrust in the spinal tap the previous afternoon, and introduced a
                            set of nanosites—nanotechnological parasites—under the supervision of Miss Pao.

                                on whatever afferent nerves they happened to bump up against. These nerves, used by the

                            Three people were waiting. Bud took a seat and skimmed a mediatron from the coffee table; it
                            looked exactly like a dirty, wrinkled, blank sheet of paper. “ 'Annals of Self-Protection,'
                            ” he said, loud enough for everyone else in the place to hear him. The logo of his favorite
                            meedfeed coalesced on the page. Mediaglyphics, mostly the cool animated ones, arranged
                            themselves in a grid. Bud scanned through them until he found the one that denoted a
                            comparison of a bunch of different stuff, and snapped at it with his fingernail. New
                            mediaglyphics appeared, surrounding larger cine panes in which Annals staff tested several
                            models of skull guns against live and dead targets. Bud frisbeed the mediatron back onto the
                            table; this was the same review he'd been poring over for the last day, they hadn't updated
                            it, his decision was still valid. One of the guys ahead of him got a tattoo, which took
                            about ten seconds. The other guy just wanted his skull gun reloaded, which didn't take much
                            longer. The girl wanted a few 'sites replaced in her racting grid, mostly around her eyes,
                            where she was starting to wrinkle up. That took a while, so Bud picked up the mediatron
                            again and went in a ractive, his favorite, called Shut Up or Die!

                            of that of a helicopter blade, but noisier,” Miss Pao said, gazing up at Judge Fang over the
                            half-lenses of her phenomenoscopic spectacles. Her eyes went out of focus, and she winced;
                            she had been lost in some enhanced three-dimensional image, and the adjustment to dull
                            reality was disorienting. “A cluster of such patterns was recognized by one of Shanghai
                            P.D.'s sky-eyes at ten seconds after 2351 hours.” As Miss Pao worked her way through this
                            summary, images appeared on the big sheet of mediatronic paper that Judge Fang had unrolled
                            across his brocade tablecloth and held down with carved jade paperweights. At the moment,
                            the image was a map of a Leased Territory called Enchantment, with one location, near the
                            Causeway, highlighted.
                            <b>
                                In the corner was another pane containing a standard picture of an anticrime sky-eye,
                                which always looked, to Judge Fang, like an American football as redesigned by
                                fetishists: glossy and black and studded. Miss Pao continued, “The sky-eye dispatched a
                                flight of eight smaller aerostats equipped with cine cameras.” The kinky football was
                                replaced by a picture of a teardrop-shaped craft, about the size of an almond, trailing
                                a whip antenna, with an orifice at its nose protected by an incongruously beautiful
                                iris.
                            </b>
                            Judge Fang was not really looking; at least three-quarters of the cases that came before him
                            commenced with a summary almost exactly like this one. It was a credit to Miss Pao's
                            seriousness and diligence that she was able to tell each story afresh. It was a challenge to
                            Judge Fang's professionalism for him to listen to each one in the same spirit. “Converging
                            on the scene,” Miss Pao said, “they recorded activities.” The large map image on Judge
                            Fang's scroll was replaced by a cine feed. The figures were far away, flocks of relatively
                            dark pixels nudging their way across a rough gray background like starlings massing before a
                            winter gale. They got bigger and more clearly defined as the aerostat flew closer to the
                            action.

                            “Common as the air” meant something worthless, but Hackworth knew that every breath of air
                            that Fiona drew, lying in her little bed at night, just a silver glow in the moonlight, was
                            used by her body to make skin and hair and bones. The air became Fiona, and deserving—no,
                            demanding—of love. Ordering matter was the sole endeavor of Life, whether it was a jumble of
                            self-replicating molecules in the primordial ocean, or a steam-powered English mill turning
                            weeds into clothing, or Fiona lying in her bed turning air into Fiona. A leaf of paper was
                            about a hundred thousand nanometers thick; a third of a million atoms could fit into this
                            span.
                            <b>
                                Smart paper consisted of a network of infinitesimal computers sandwiched between
                                mediatrons. A mediatron was a thing that could change its color from place to place; two
                                of them accounted for about two-thirds of the paper's thickness, leaving an internal gap
                                wide enough to contain structures a hundred thousand atoms wide. Light and air could
                                easily penetrate to this point, so the works were contained within vacuoles—airless
                                buckminsterfullerene shells overlaid with a reflective aluminum layer so that they would
                                not implode en masse whenever the page was exposed to sunlight. The interiors of the
                                buckyballs, then, constituted something close to a eutactic environment. Here resided
                                the rod logic that made the paper smart. Each of these spherical computers was linked to
                                its four neighbors, north-east-south-west, by a bundle of flexible pushrods running down
                                a flexible, evacuated buckytube, so that the page as a whole constituted a parallel
                                computer made up of about a billion separate processors. The individual processors
                                weren't especially smart or fast and were so susceptible to the elements that typically
                                only a small fraction of them were working, but even with those limitations the smart
                                paper still constituted, among other things, a powerful graphical computer.

                            And still, Hackworth reflected, it had nothing on Runcible, whose pages were thicker and
                            more densely packed with computational machinery, each sheet folded four times into a
                            sixteen-page signature, thirty-two signatures brought together in a spine that, in addition
                            to keeping the book from falling apart, functioned as an enormous switching system and
                            database. It was made to be robust, but it still had to be born in the eutactic womb, a
                            solid diamond vacuum chamber housing a start matter compiler.
