                            right and down on the basin floor curving out beneath them. He stared down through smoke
                            bushes and weeds into a wedged slab sand-surface of moonlight inhabited by an up-hop, jump,
                            pop-hop of tiny motion.

                            yellow band. Jamis stepped into the ring, slipped out of his robe and tossed it to someone
                            in the crowd. He stood there in a cloudy gray slickness of stillsuit that was patched and
                            marked by tucks and gathers. For a moment, he bent with his mouth to his shoulder, drinking
                            from a <b>catchpocket</b> tube. Presently he straightened, peeled off and detached the suit,
                            handed it carefully into the crowd. He stood waiting, clad in loincloth and some tight
                            fabric over his feet, a crysknife in his right hand. Jessica saw the girl-child Chani
                            helping Paul, saw her press a crysknife handle into his palm, saw him heft it, testing the
                            weight and balance. And it came to Jessica that Paul had been trained in prana and bindu,
                            the nerve and the fiber--that he had been taught fighting in a deadly school, his teachers
                            men like Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, men who were legends in their own lifetimes. The
                            boy knew the devious ways of the Bene Gesserit and he looked supple and confident.

                            The hood had been ripped from the cloak, but the man had fashioned a turban from a torn
                            strip of cloth. Wisps of sandy hair protruded from it, matched by a sparse beard and thick
                            brows. Beneath the blue-within-blue eyes, remains of a dark stain spread down to his cheeks.
                            A matted depression across mustache and beard showed where a stillsuit tube had marked out
                            its path from nose to <b>catchpockets</b>. The man stopped half across the dunecrest, arms
                            stretched down the slipface.

                            Paul looked down, saw sand still spewing out of the metal and plastic monster beneath them.
                            It looked like a great tan and blue beetle with many wide tracks extending on arms around
                            it. He saw a giant inverted funnel snout poked into dark sand in front of it.

                            The tall eastern face of the ship glistened in the flat light of the sun, but the shadow
                            side still showed yellow portholes from glowglobes of the night...

                            It wasn't the lighter that excited Stilgar's awe, Paul knew, but the construction for which
                            the lighter was only the centerpost. A single metal hutment, many stories tall, reached out
                            in a thousand-meter circle from the base of the lighter -- a tent composed of interlocking
                            metal leaves -- the temporary lodging place for five legions of Sardaukar and His Imperial
                            Majesty, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV...

                            all the fringe parasites of the Court. All here -- fawning, slyly plotting, "roughing it"

                            civilizations. DEATH TRIPOD: originally; the tripod upon which desert executioners hanged
                            their victims. By usage: the three members of a Cherem sworn to the same revenge. DERCH:
                            right turn; a worm steersman's call. DEW COLLECTORS or DEW PRECIPITATORS: not to be confused

                            centimeters on the long axis. They are made of chromoplastic that turns a reflecting white
                            when subjected to light, and reverts to transparency in darkness. The collector forms a
                            markedly cold surface upon which dawn dew will precipitate. They are used by Fremen to line
                            concave planting depressions where they provide a small but reliable source of water. DEW
                            GATHERERS: workers who reap dew from the plants of Arrakis, using a scythelike dew reaper.
                            DEMIBROTHERS: sons of concubines in the same household and certified as having the same

                            royal person or member of a Great House by informal treachery. The rule sets up the formal
                            outline and limits the means of assassination. DISTRANS: a device for producing a temporary
                            neural imprint on the nervous system of Chiroptera or birds. The creature's normal cry then
                            carries the message imprint which can be sorted from that carrier wave by another distrans.
                            DRUM SAND: impaction of sand in such away that any sudden blow against its surface produces
                            a distinct drum sound. DOORSEAL: a portable plastic hermetic seal used for moisture security
                            in Fremen overday cave camps. DUMP BOXES: the general term for any cargo container of
                            irregular shape and equipped with ablation surfaces and suspensor damping system. They are
                            used to dump material from space onto a planet's surface. DUNE MEN: idiomatic for open sand
                            workers, spice hunters and the like on Arrakis. Sandworkers. Spiceworkers. DUST CHASM: any
                            deep crevasse or depression on the desert of Arrakis that has been filled with dust not
                            apparently different from the surrounding surface; a deadly trap because human or animal
                            will sink in it and smother. (See Tidal Dust Basin.) ECAZ: fourth planet of Alpha Centauri
                            B; the sculptors' paradise, so called because it is the home of fogwood, the plant growth
                            capable of being shaped in situ solely by the power of human thought. EGO-LIKENESS:
                            portraiture reproduced through a shigawire projector that is capable of reproducing subtle
                            movements said to convey the ego essence. ELACCA DRUG: narcotic formed by burning
                            blood-grained elacca wood of Ecas. Its effect is to remove most of the will to
                            self-preservation. Druggee skin shows a characteristic carrot color. Commonly used to
                            prepare slave gladiators for the ring. EL-SAYAL: the "rain of sand." A fall of dust which
                            has been carried to medium altitude (around 2,000 meters) by a coriolis storm. El-sayals
                            frequently bring moisture to ground level. ERG: an extensive dune area, a sea of sand. FAI:
                            the water tribute, chief specie of tax on Arrakis.

                            Arrakis, first to rise in the night; notable for a distinct human fist pattern on its
                            surface. FREE TRADERS: idiomatic for smugglers. FREMEN: the free tribes of Arrakis, dwellers
                            in the desert, remnants of the Zensunni Wanderers. ("Sand Pirates" according to the Imperial

                            its hedonistic culture and exotic sexual practices. GARE: butte. GATHERING: distinguished
                            from Council Gathering. It is a formal convocation of Fremen leaders to witness a combat
                            that determines tribal leadership. (A Council Gathering is an assembly to arrive at
                            decisions involving all the tribes.) GEYRAT: straight ahead; a worm steersman's call.

                            in shadows, spinning under the impetus of a fat hand that glittered with rings. The globe
                            sat on a freeform stand at one wall of a windowless room whose other walls presented a
                            patchwork of multicolored scrolls, filmbooks, tapes and reels.

                            Slowly, feeling the compulsions and unable to inhibit them, Paul put his hand into the box.
                            He felt first a sense of cold as the blackness closed around his hand, then slick metal
                            against his fingers and a prickling as though his hand were asleep.
                            A predatory look filled the old woman's features. She lifted her right hand away from the
                            box and poised the hand close to the side of Paul's neck. He saw a glint of metal there and
                            started to turn toward it. "Stop!" she snapped.

                            Using the Voice again! He swung his attention back to her face.

                            "I hold at your neck the <b>gom jabbar</b>," she said. "The <b>gom jabbar</b>, the
                            high-handed enemy. It's
                            a needle with a drop of poison on its tip. Ah-ah! Don't pull away or you'll feel that
                            poison."

                            Paul tried to swallow in a dry throat. He could not take his attention from the seamed old
                            face, the glistening eyes, the pale gums around silvery metal teeth that flashed as she
                            spoke.

                            "A duke's son must know about poisons," she said. "It's the way of our times, eh?

                            Pride overcame Paul's fear. "You dare suggest a duke's son is an animal?" he demanded.

                            "Let us say I suggest you may be human," she said. "Steady! I warn you not to try jerking
                            away. I am old, but my hand can drive this needle into your neck before you escape me."

                            long. Paul recognized it at once - a common assassination weapon that every child of royal
                            blood learned about at an early age. It was a ravening sliver of metal guided by some

                            The seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back. Through Paul's mind flashed the
                            related knowledge, the <b>hunter-seeker</b> limitations: Its compressed suspensor field
                            distorted the vision of its transmitter eye. With nothing but the dim light of the room to
                            reflect his target, the operator would be relying on motion--anything that moved.

                            Hawat said--" "It was a <b>hunter-seeker</b>," she reminded him "That means someone inside

                            spirited in here after Hawat's investigation." But she thought of the message of the leaf: "
                            . . . defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant."

                            travel and transport and upon international banking is taken as the beginning point of the
                            Imperial Calendar. HAGAL: the "Jewel Planet" (II Theta Shaowei), mined out in the time of

                            Zensunni migration. It is supposed to have been a no longer existent satellite of Delta
                            Pavonis. HARVESTER or HARVESTER FACTORY: a large (often 120 meters by 40 meters) spice
                            mining machine commonly employed on rich, uncontaminated melange blows. (Often called a
                            "crawler" because of buglike body on independent tracks.) HEIGHLINER: major cargo carrier of
                            the Spacing Guild's transportation system. HIEREG: temporary Fremen desert camp on open
                            sand. HIGH COUNCIL: the Landsraad inner circle empowered to act as supreme tribunal in House

                            Its wings crept out to full reach, began the cupping action of a quick stop. Hawat's

                            unshielded because of the lasgun activity around it. Straight into the carrier the diving
                            'thopter plunged. A flaming roar shook the basin.

                            "You'll be the Duke someday, Son," his father said. "A <b>Mentat</b> Duke
                            would be formidable indeed. Can you decide now . . . or do you need

                            looked like a bowl with an arrow spilling out of it. "There are many Harkonnen patrols," he
                            said. He lifted his finger, pointed upward across the cliffs that Hawat and his men had
                            descended. Hawat nodded. Many patrols. Yes. But still he did not know what this Fremen
                            wanted and this rankled. <b>Mentat training</b> was supposed to give a man the power to see

                            Five legions--fifty brigades! --attacking the Duke's main base at Arrakeen. A legion at
                            Arsunt. Two battle groups at Splintered Rock. Then the reports became more detailed--there
                            were Imperial Sardaukar among the attackers--possibly two legions of them. And it became
                            clear that the invaders knew precisely which weight of arms to send where. Precisely! Superb
                            Intelligence. Hawat's shocked fury had mounted until it threatened the smooth functioning of
                            his <b>Mentat capabilities</b>. The size of the attack struck his mind like a physical blow.
                            Now,
                            hiding beneath a bit of desert rock, he nodded to himself, pulled his torn and slashed tunic
                            around him as though warding off the cold shadows. The size of the attack. He had always
                            expected their enemy to hire an occasional lighter from the Guild for probing raids.

                            my trade?" he asked, and he did not try to hide the disdain in his voice. "Anything outside

                            desert. FIRST MOON: the major satellite of Arrakis, first to rise in the night; notable for
                            a distinct human fist pattern on its surface. FREE TRADERS: idiomatic for smugglers. FREMEN:
                            the free tribes of Arrakis, dwellers in the desert, remnants of the Zensunni Wanderers.
                            ("Sand Pirates" according to the Imperial Dictionary.) FREMKIT: desert survival kit of
                            Fremen manufacture. FRIGATE: largest spaceship that can be grounded on a planet and taken
                            off in one piece. GALACH: official language of the Imperium. Hybrid Inglo-Slavic with strong
                            traces of cultural-specialization terms adopted during the long chain of human migrations.
                            GAMONT: third planet of Niushe; noted for its hedonistic culture and exotic sexual
                            practices. GARE: butte. GATHERING: distinguished from Council Gathering. It is a formal
                            convocation of Fremen leaders to witness a combat that determines tribal leadership. (A
                            Council Gathering is an assembly to arrive at decisions involving all the tribes.) GEYRAT:
                            straight ahead; a worm steersman's call. GHAFLA: giving oneself up to gadfly distractions.
                            Thus: a changeable person, one not to be trusted. GHANIMA: something acquired in battle or
                            single combat. Commonly, a memento of combat kept only to stir the memory. GIEDI PRIME: the
                            planet of Ophiuchi B (36), homeworld of House Harkonnen.

                            From the folds of her gown, she lifted a green metal cube about fifteen centimeters on a
                            side. She turned it and Paul saw that one side was open - black and oddly frightening. Paul
                            slowly put his hand into the box. He first felt a sense of cold as the blackness closed
                            around his hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as though his hand
                            were asleep...
                            "What's in the box?"

                            "Pain." He felt increased tingling in his hand, pressed his lips tightly together. How could
                            this be a test? he wondered. The tingling became an itch... The itch became the faintest
                            burning... It mounted slowly: heat upon heat upon heat... . The burning! The burning! He
                            thought he could feel skin curling black on that agonized hand, the flesh crisping and
                            dropping away until only charred bones remained.

                            It stopped! As though a switch had been turned off, the pain stopped... "Take your hand from
                            the box, young human, and look at it." He fought down an aching shiver, stared at the
                            lightless void where his hand seemed to remain of its own volition. Memory of pain inhibited
                            every movement. Reason told him he would withdraw a blackened stump from that box. "Do it!"
                            she snapped. He jerked his hand from the box, stared at it astonished. Not a mark. No sign
                            of agony on the flesh.

                            And more were coming...

                            Men came with rolled carpets, grunting under the weight of them, stirring up dust as the
                            loads were dropped onto the ledge... [Jessica] watched the me unroll the carpets, covering
                            the ledge, looked out at the crowd. There were at least ten thousand people on the rock

                            the force given it by the acoustical horn behind the ridge.

                            to rest and restore himself -- into the south where the women and the families had been
                            hidden from the pogrom among the new palmaries and <b>sietch</b> warrens. He lifted his head
                            and
                            looked to the south, reminding himself that the maker summoned wild from the erg was an
                            unknown quantity, and the one who summoned it was equally unknown to this test. "You must
                            gauge the approaching maker carefully," Stilgar had explained. "You must stand close enough
                            that you can mount it as it passes, yet not so close that it engulfs you."

                            contact with the palm of the human hand to which it has been keyed. PAN: on Arrakis, any
                            lowlying region or depression created by the subsiding of the underlying basement complex.

                                thirty-three liters, seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms. Superb accuracy in water
                                measurement, Jessica thought.

                            And she noted that the walls of the meter trough held no trace of moisture after the water's
                            passage. The water flowed off those walls without binding tension. She saw a profound clue
                            to Fremen technology in the simple fact: they were perfectionists.

                            Jessica felt the dry pulling of skin on her cheeks and forehead relaxing in the presence of
                            moisture. The water pool was deep; she could sense its deepness, and resisted a desire to
                            dip her hands into it.

                                A splashing sounded on her left. She looked down the shadowy line of Fremen, saw Stilgar
                                with Paul standing beside him and the watermasters emptying their load into the pool
                                through a flowmeter. The meter was a round gray eye above the pool's rim. She saw its
